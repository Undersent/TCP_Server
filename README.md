# TCP_Server
TCP server to talk with bot

-Server can serve lots of users

-Server has RSA connection (hand made, primes hardcoded)

1. User can talk with bot using https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot (I tried with LSTM(Keras), but I have a weak GPU)

2. User can ask for word correctness. (Server uses hand made ternary tree structure, and edit distance) 

3. User can ask for a joke about chuck norris. (hand made GET)

I tried to write everything by myself and not use any additional libraries.
