# TCP_Server
TCP server to talk with bot

-Server can serve lots of users

-Server has RSA connection

1. User can talk with bot using https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot

2. User can ask for a check how to write a word.

3. User can ask for a joke about chuck norris.

I tried to write everything by myself and not use any additional libraries.
